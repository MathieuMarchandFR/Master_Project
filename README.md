# Master_Project

## Abstract

The purpose of this master project is to provide a prediction of the level of French groundwater
in France. The database is provided by the government organization ADES and contains the
observations of 4771 piezometers in Metropolitan France (including the Corse region). The
time scope is from January 2000 to December 2021. The predictions cover the years 2022, 2025
and 2030. Various models have been used: ARIMA model and SARIMA model. The baseline
model is composed of the mean of the observations on the train period. Statistical indicators are
used to choose the best model for each prediction and the results are gathered by department
and by basin to ease the visualization and the interpretation.
